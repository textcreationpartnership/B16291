            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>:</hi> but where Nobilitie is grac'd with vertue, such a man is a most fit Patron, as <hi>Theophilus.</hi> Now because I find both those combin'd in your Lordship, I am bold
<pb facs="tcp:179309:3"/> to put these my latter gleanings vnder your Lordships Patrocinie.</p>
            <p>A second reason, which moved me to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer these my travels to your Lordship, is this: I remembred that Apologue in the Talmud: <note place="margin">Talmud Cholin. 62. 1.</note> The grapes in <hi>Babell</hi> sent vpon a time to the vine leaues in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> desiring them to come and overshadow them, otherwise the heate would consume them, and so neuer come to maturitie. Your Lordship knowes well the mythologie of this Apologue: If learning be not sheltred by those who are in eminent pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and if they cast not their shadow over it, it will soone perish: but where they favour it, then it prospers. If the spring be cold, then plants, herbs, and the blossome of the Trees wither; but where the influence is seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then all things reviue: So where great men are averse to Learning, the spirits which otherwise could blossome, wither, and deay: but where it is vpholden by men of higher place, it is like a Fountaine of liuing water. <note place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A third reason, which moved me to offer these my travels to your Lordship, is, your Lordships ingenuitie, who will cover such things as are said amisse here, (for who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of such Antiquities, and so diverse, will still touch the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

How farre the Potentates of the world, haue advanced themselues in his service, our Histories doe sufficiently declare, who (with many learned Fathers of the Church) haue inrolled in their famous writings, all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer infamous hereticks, and their blasphemies, to their perpetuall shame.</p>
            <p>The Papists (as naturall children) succeeded to those viperous Parents, but haue farre exceeded them in number of heresies, and barbarous cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: setting forward Satans former policie, with all their might. For as they haue written very basely of the holy Scriptures; so haue they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled, the writings of man vnto them, and honoured the <hi>Apocryphe</hi> Bookes, with that stately throne, in the which <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> sitteth, as the onely high, and mightie commander: yea, they thundred Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications and <hi>Marana-tha,</hi> against any of the <hi>Laiks</hi> (as they call them) that dare reade, any part of Scripture in their owne tongue.</p>
            <p>But behold the great mercy of God to his Church; for, although, all those laboured to haue quenched the light of the Word, and to depriue the Church of that glorious Lampe; yet they haue come far short there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and were never able to ecclipse that Sun-shine of the Church, though they did stretch out the wings of their malice, to the ends of the earth. I referre thee <hi>(good Christian Reader)</hi> to the view of those godly and learned Instruments, whom God of his mercy raised vp, (as valiant men) to withstand this hereticall furie; whose invincible courage learning and constancie, did amase the adversaries; I forbeare to excerp particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: you haue a cloud of witnesses, specified by <hi>Irenaeus, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, Hierome,</hi> and diverse other.</p>

And because the word of God hath a most sweet relish about all things; he doth instruct thee how to discerne the same, that thou may'st be drunke with the waters of life. The Author, besides the most appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Greeke and Latine Writers, hath well read with deliberation also, the ancient customes of the Iewes, in their owne <hi>Rabbines,</hi> and hath mentioned so many of them, as giues no small light for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Text, and likewise hath had conferrence vpon the same things with the most approved Schollers of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Let me exhort thee <hi>Christian Reader,</hi> to a diligent studie of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginalls, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greeke,</hi> with all their dialects especially, the <hi>Chaldaean, Syrian, Arabicke,</hi> and <hi>Samaritan,</hi> which are great Lights and Illustrations for the Text, whereby thou maiest more easily, not onely follow the rules, which the Author setteth before thee, in his Cannons gathered from Scripture, in his Confirmations by Scripture, and Illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both from the Scripture it selfe, and from Writers, both Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and profane: But also thou mayest delight thy selfe, in the pleasant fields of the Old and New Testament.</p>
            <p>I am assured thou shalt greatly increase thy knowledge by reading this Booke: for as others that are not yet acquainted with the Originals, haue reapt no small comfort, by reading some scattered sheetes, that came to my hand from the Presse: What mayest thou expect after thy diligent labours therein. Thou canst not praise God sufficiently, who hath offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee, the painefull travels of such learned men, that thou mayest know another day how to worke in the Lords Vineyard.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Reader,</hi> whose purpose is not to Preach the VVord, but to profit by the same as a reverend hearer. I dare assure thee, that by this learned VVorke (if thou pervse diligently) thou shalt attaine to great light and knowledge in the holy VVord, and shalt finde many places thereof farre more clearely opened vp then thou didst expect.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ruah hakkodesh,</hi> the holy Spirit, was that sort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which was revealed to the Prophets, when they had the vse of their senses, speaking and hearing as we doe: they were inspired also by the holy Spirit, but not in so high a degree as these, who had the gift of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, this sort of revelation was most vsuall in the second Temple.</p>
               <p>There are sundry sorts of spirituall knowledge: the first is of Faith: the second of Prophecie: the third of Glory. That Prophecie which is intellectuall, shewing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to the mind without means, is most perfect; that which is shewed to the sense is most imperfect, and it comes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

The third of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Glorie, which is most perfit, and intellectually shewed to the minde: the senses not abstracted nor dazeled. <hi>Moses</hi> came neerest to this knowledge.</p>
               <p>The revelation by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> is not expresly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> set downe: <note n="r" place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 9.</note>
                  <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinkes, when they were to goe to battell, the Priest putting his Ephod vpon him; if they were to march, then the stones did shine, but if the stones did not shine, then they were to stay: but this seemes not to haue bin a sufficient way to haue directed them in other cases: for when the Priest put vpon him his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod, &amp; consulted with the Lord whether they should goe against the Philistims, or not: the Lord answered, <hi>Thou shalt not ascend directly, but goe a compasse about.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 5. 1 King. 6. 3.</note> How could these stones haue manifested all these things to them?

                  <p>God the Father sanctified these two languages, when <note place="margin">Illust.</note> his Secretaries wrote the holy Scriptures.

               <p>The right pointing is, not to make a Comma after <hi>Kish,</hi> but after <hi>Iemini:</hi> for if it be set after <hi>Kish,</hi> then the relatiue will haue relation to <hi>Mordecai;</hi> then <hi>Mordecai</hi> should haue liued from the captivitie of <hi>Ieconiah,</hi> till the Persian Monarchy.

               </p>
               <p>The wrong pointing is, <hi>That of workes a man is iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not of faith, * onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it were thus pointed, then it should carry this sense, <hi>Ye see then that a man is iustified by workes, and not onely iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by faith:</hi> That is, <hi>That he is both iustified by workes and faith;</hi> but the point is to be placed before <hi>and,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>That this is the right pointing, and that the place hath this meaning; it is evident thus.</p>
               <p>First, by the drift of the place, which is not to shew, what place faith hath in iustification, for that is <hi>Pauls</hi> drift. <hi>Rom. 4. 5.</hi> But to shew what faith it is, that hath place in iustification against Solifidians.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the examples alledged, for <hi>Abraham</hi> was iustified before God, long before the oblation of <hi>Isaac;</hi> and <hi>Rahabs</hi> worke could not iustisie her before God, because she was stained with many imperfections.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:179309:33"/>
               <p>Thirdly, by collation of other places of the same Text, vers. 14. where he speaketh of the having of faith with workes: and not of iustifying by workes with faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Syriack translates it <hi>fide sola, faith alone.</hi>

               <p>The commands are pointed after another manner, then any of the rest of the Scriptures; for some of them ye shall see distinguished by a full point, and lightly: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so ye shall see <hi>Atnach</hi> and <hi>Zakeph katon,</hi> that is, Colon and Comma <hi>maior</hi> both ioyned, the first as a note of greater distinction, and this of a lesser.

               <p>Whence came this divers pointing of the Law. <label type="milestone">

               <p>The reason which the Iewes giue is ridiculous, they <label type="milestone">

                  </label> say the commands are all ioyned together without any full distinction, <hi>Bedibbur echad, sermone vno,</hi> at one speech, that is, without any rest, because God pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them all with one breath.

               <p>But the truth is, that the commands, as they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, so there is a full point, to make the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but because there is a great affinitie amongst them,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:179309:33"/> therefore it is also that they are lightly distinguished; &amp; it is to be marked, that these commands which are set downe without any coniunction in <hi>Exodus</hi> the <hi>20.

                  </gap>. in the Law, and by three great <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Prophets. But there is one of them, <hi>Gen. 47. 28.</hi> which is not distinguished as the rest, by three great P. P. P. And the Iewes giue the reason to be this, because it is the shutting vp of the Booke of <hi>Genesis,</hi> yea and of the whole Law and Prophets to the comming of the Messias: and because the time of his comming was not expresly set downe; therefore they continued this Section with the former.</p>
               <p>The occasion why they ioyned these parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, with these of the Law, was this; when they were vnder the persecution of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes;</hi> He pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted <note place="margin">1 Math. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As for this place <hi>Gen. 1. 1. In the beginning God created</hi>

               <p>The second distinction was this; <hi>These were the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 9.</note>
                  <hi>of Moab.</hi> In place of these words, they made choice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the words of the Prophet, <hi>Esay 54. 11. Canta sterilis, Sing thou barren:</hi> for as the first place intreats of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

               <p>Their third distinction was, <hi>Gen. 12. 1. Abi tibi, Goe vnto a land:</hi> For this, they made choice of the fortie of <hi>Esay,</hi> from the 25. verse to the sixteenth of the forty one Chapter: for as in this Section of <hi>Genesis,</hi> the departing of <hi>Abraham</hi> out of his owne Countrey to a strange land is handled. So in this Section of the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> there is a comfort set downe to the Israelites in banishment. And so forth to the end of the Law; as yee may <note n="m" place="margin">Biblia He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braica.</note> see the places paralleld in the end of the Hebrew Bible.</p>
               <p>When the tyrannie of <hi>Antiochus</hi> was ended, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan againe to reade <hi>Moses</hi> after the old manner, and they read still the places of the Prophets with him. These places of the Prophets they called <hi>Haphtara</hi> from <hi>Patar cessare,</hi> to cease, for they being ended, they went home, and he was called <hi>Maphtir cessator,</hi> who read this last part in the Prophets.</p>
               <p>When they ended the reading of the Law, they had a feast, which they called <hi>Schimchath tora, laetitia legis,</hi> the ioy of the Law: this was the 23. of <hi>Tizri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Sections or divisions received in the Liturgie of the Church, were not <hi>Divinae institutionis,</hi> by diuine appointment: for oftentimes they make a Section, where there should be a continuance of the History.</p>
               <p>The eleuenth of <hi>Genesis,</hi> at the 32. verse, is separate by their Section, from <hi>Genesis</hi> the twelfth, where the History is continued; for God spake these things to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> when he was in Mesopotamia, before he came to Charran. <hi>Act. 7. 3.</hi>
               </p>

                  <note n="n" place="margin">Scaliger de emend. lib. 7.</note> They began not to take vp their mourning againe, till the 24. day of the moneth: the 23. day was a day of ioy, because they ended the reading of the Law that day.</p>
               <p>The latter Iewes appointed many fasts and feasts (as <label type="milestone">

                  </label> may be seene in the Kalender) which they had no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for out of the Word of God: neither is the ground cleare enough out of this place, that they keepe the feast that day, that it will now follow?</p>
               <p>When they ended the reading of the Law, the next Sabboth they called it <hi>Sabboth Beresheth, requies in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio:</hi> they began their reading in this moneth of <hi>Tizri,</hi> because they held generally that the world was created in September.</p>
               <p>Besides the reading vpon the Sabboth, they read these Paraschaes or Sections vpon the weeke dayes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, but they read not the whole Sections: and these who would seeme to be more devout, fasted these two dayes also: and of this the Pharise boasted, <hi>I fast twice in the Sabboth,</hi> that is, in the weeke.

                     <p>During the second Temple, the Oyle which annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the high Priest, was wanting; therefore <note n="x" place="margin">Rabbi Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.

                        <p>It was not Sacramentall. The first Reason: because <label type="milestone">

                           </label> there is no word of it in the institution of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as there is of the vnleavened Bread, and of the Lambe, and the sprinkling of the blood: for these are all commanded, but never a word of the Cuppe.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:179309:74"/> signifieth the blood of Christ in the Paschall Lambe: therefore the Wine in the cup, cannot signifie the same here.</p>

Secondly, in their Paschall Supepr, their Cup was occasionall, and not essentiall to the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, for they vsed it as common drinke with their meate. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the vnleavened bread was not occasionall in the Dimissorie Supper: because they had no other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> bread in the Paschall Supepr.

Thirdly, their Sacraments were to them, both temporall refreshments, and spirituall. For if the water which came out of the Rocke, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. they with their beasts dranke both of it, yet it was Sacramentall to them. Why might there not be in this Supper, both that which was Sacramentall, and that which was for their naturall refreshment also? Wherefore our Saviour Christ, when he saith; <hi>Hence-forth I will drinke no more of the fruit of the vine.</hi> He alludes here onely, to the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:179309:74"/> Canon of the Iewes; wherein it was forbidden them that night, after they had drunk in the last Cup. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ transfers not the Cup of the old Testament, to the Cup Sacramentall in the new Testament, as some hold.</p>

                           </label> the Essence of Religion is changed; secondly, when the state of Religion is changed; thirdly, when the Essence is changed in part; fourthly, when the rites of Religion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are changed. When the Essence of Religion is changed, (this is, as when a man is raised from death to life;) as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when a Turke becomes a Christian. The second change in religion, is, when the state is changed (this is, as when a Boy becomes a man.) When Christ changed the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe into the Lords Supper, and the Disciples, the Iewish Sabboth into the Lords day: here the Essence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is not changed, but the state. The third change is, when the Essence is changed in part; (as when a man who is sicke, becomes whole:) and one is Orthodoxe in all points of Religion, except one, he is converted also in that point; here the Essence is in part changed. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> fourth change of Religion, is, when the rites are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: this is like the change of a mans cloathes. Here in this change of the Paschall Lambe into the Supper of the Lord, the state and rites were changed, but not the Essence, neither in whole, nor in part.</p>

                     <p>The houres in this Diall, are called vn-equall houres; not in this respect, that some houres in one day are lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or shorter then others are: but comparing one day with another, the houres are longer or shorter, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Sunne ascends or descends from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall to the Tropicks.</p>
                     <p>This in-equalitie of the houres, and lengthning or shortning of the day, was knowne by the signes in the Zodiacke, and the Sunnes remouing from the one Tropicke to the other, having past the Equinoctiall line; this in-equilitie of houres, with vs here in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land would be very great: for our longest day on the South parts hath 18. Equinoctiall houres, and our shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test day but six Equinoctiall houres; so that if the in-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall houres were set on our Dials, there would be great in-equalitie; for, in Summer the in-equall houres, would containe an houre and an halfe of Equinoctiall houres: and in Winter the vnequal houres would be halfe Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall houres.

               <p>If the Morall Law be perpetuall, how is it that God <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>
                  </label> hath given a dispensation to some to breake these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scotus</hi> markes well, that the Law standing in force, it <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                  </label> implyes a contrandiction to dispense with it: but by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, he vnderstands onely the revocation of it for such a time, to such a person.</p>
               <p>The <note n="g" place="margin">Scotus.</note> Law of Nature (saith he) is taken two manner of wayes; strictly, and largely: Strictly, which by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:179309:145"/> and evident consequences are concluded: Largely, which inferres not a necessarie and evident consequences as the first.</p>
               <p>Of the first he giues an Example, <hi>the whole is more then the part,</hi> therefore a house is more then any part of it: this consequence followes in the strictest significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: so, <hi>good is to be embraced,</hi> therefore <hi>euill is to be shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the second he giues this Example, <hi>we ought to liue peaceably with others in the Common-wealth.</hi> Of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, it will not follow necessarily, therefore <hi>Possessions are to be divided, or not tobe divided:</hi> for both may stand, if the Common-wealth were well constitute, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple agreed together. Communitie of goods would not breake the peace of the Common-wealth; but because people are much giuen to selfe-loue, therefore diuision of goods is a good meane, to make the people liue pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably together.</p>
               <p>So (saith he) this conclusion followes necessarily in the strictest signification, <hi>God is to be worshipped,</hi> therefore, <hi>we cannot worship an Idoll.</hi> But this followes not in the strictest signification, neither hath it <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secam connexionem; God is to be loued, therefore man is to be loued:</hi> there is onely a conformitie betwixt these two.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Scotus</hi> answeres, this sinne comes by revelation of a new Law by God himselfe: so the precepts of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table are so neere vnto the first principles, that they are called the Law of Nature in the largest sense; and Reason teacheth all men to keepe the same, as nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest vnto the first Principles.</p>
               <p>Precepts of the first Table cannot be dispensed with, without a staine of his owne holinesse, for they are the Principles of nature in the strictest sense. God
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:179309:145"/> cannot dispense that a man should hate him, <hi>sine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinseca repugnantia;</hi> so, that one should worship an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol.</p>

                  <hi>Peronius</hi> the Cardinall sets downe two Rules, to try whether the testimonie of the Fathers is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>The first is, that we must hold them for a sufficient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> consent, to whom the most famous of every Nation consent in affirming a thing, and none haue opposed themselues to those, who are holden to be Orthodoxe.</p>
               <p>The second, when the <note n="f" place="margin">Causabon. epist. ad Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronium, Pag. 32, 33.</note> Fathers speake not this as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Doctors or Teachers, when they say this or that is to be done; but when a switnesses, they say, that such a thing is to be beleeved, which the Catholique Church does or beleeues.</p>

               <p>In citation of Scripture for probation, wee are not <note place="margin">Canon.</note> bound to keepe the same order as in reading of a Text.</p>
               <p>It is one thing of purpose to set downe a Scripture, <note place="margin">Illust.</note> and another to cite a Scripture for confirmation. In Exodus the Commandements are set downe one way; <note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> in Deuteronomy, thsi order is not kept: because he is <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 6.</note> interpreting the Law, &amp; not setting it downe. So when Christ cites the Commandements, he sets adultery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muther. So the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 12.</hi> Why? Because he is not of purpose handling them, but vsing them there fore probation: But in setting downe the Text, and interpreting it, he must not alter a Lot.</p>
               <p>The Church of Rome then, and the Lutherane Churches, are to be blamed, when they set downe the Commandements for the ground of their doctrine; they alter the forme set downe by God him-selfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the first and second Commandement; and dividing the last into two, to make a probation for their graven images.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The first estate of a Christian in his fight against sin.</note> dereliction, that he is left of God.</p>
                  <p>This is the Consolation, that God can never leaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> him. For the better vnderstanding of this, marke that first, in Christ there are three Coniunctions: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Godhead and manhead, that was a divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction. The second, betwixt his sould and bodie, that was a naturall coniunction. The third, betwixt his soule and grace, that was a spirituall coniunction. Marke how the divine coniunction, excels the naturall coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so doth the spirituall, excell the naturall.</p>
                  <p>1. Christs Godhead and his manhood could never be separated; for when his manhood was in the graue it was the body of God; otherwise at the Resurrection, there had beene a new incarnation. 2. Christs soule and grace could never be separate, onely Christs soule and bodie were separate by death, therefore grace and the soule can never separate againe. If the first linke of a Chaine hold, then the rest are sure: Christs Godhead and his manhood cannot be separate; neither can his soule and grace: so neither can the soule of the childe of God and grace.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> through other, in all the faculties of the soule: for there is not a facultie, but it hath grace in it as well as sinne. <hi>Hose:</hi> describing <hi>Ephraim,</hi> sayes, that he is <hi>like</hi>

                     <hi>a Cake bak't vpon the one side, and raw vpon the other.</hi> This is not that Christian combat; if it were <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na lucta, a Christian wrastling,</hi> then there would be some part raw, and some part bak't, on euery side. When <hi>Medea</hi> said, <hi>Video meliora, &amp; deteriora sequer: I see the right, but follow the wrong;</hi> it was not <hi>lucta Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> but <hi>ethica:</hi> it was not betwixt the will, and the will; but betwixt the vnderstanding, and the will. The will was wholly the Devils here, although there was some glance of light in the vnderstanding: but in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, there is no facultie that God hath not put some grace into.</p>
                  <p>If some inferiour part be good, and the rest bad, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> man takes not the denomination from that: as a black-moore is not called white, because his teeth are white, so a bad man, having some good parts, he cannot for
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:179309:168"/> this be called good. Of two superiour parts of man, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if the liuer be good, and the heart bad, he is not called for this, a sound man; but if there be some soundnesse in both these parts, and some blemish; yet hee takes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the denomination from the better part. If the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our be bad, and the superiour good, hee takes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> from the good part. If a Target be blacke vpon the one side, and white vpon the other, the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get is neither called blacke nor white: so, <hi>this people drawes neere to me with their lips, but their hearts are farre from me:</hi> here the people are esteemed luke-warme.</p>
                  <p>To apply this vnto a Christian that is in combat; we must marke, that in the regenerate, (because both in the will and the vnderstanding there is grace and sin,) they take the denomination from the best part: grace is not onely in the inferiour, but also in the superiour part; not onely in the one part, but also in the other; although there be more sinne then grace, he takes the denomination from the best part. There is much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and little wine mixed in a glasse, yet it is called a glasse of wine: so, of a Christian; if there bee many bad parts in him, and one good, he hath the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the best part; to wit, that hee is a good Christian.</p>

                  <p>Sinne is not in them, <hi>in extensis gradibus:</hi> 1. Some sins are in the will, but not from the will, as originall sinne. 2. Some sinnes are in the will, and from the will, as the sinnes of the vnregenerate. 3. Some sinnes are partly from the will, and partly against the will; as the sinnes of the regenerate.

                  <p>The consolation of the childe of God is this; that he <note place="margin">Comfort.</note> sinnes not with full desire, because grace hinders the will not to giue full consent; the wicked hath nothing to restraine his desire, therefore he sinnes with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and greedinesse.</p>
                  <p>The childe of God and the wicked goe thus farre in <note place="margin">I.</note> sinne together. First, there is <hi>aversio,</hi> a turning away from God. 2. There is <hi>inescatio,</hi> a baite. 3. There is <hi>delectatio,</hi> a delight. 4. Consent; but here the childe of God, and the wicked part: for the childe of GOD giues never the full consent. 5. The wicked goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the fact. 6. In the habite. 7. In the gloriation. 8. In the defence. 9. In the despaire. 10. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. From consent to condemnation they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much differ, if not altogether. The childe of God, and the wicked commit the selfe-same sinne, but not after the same manner. A woman who beares her childe in the seaventh month, and shee who beares her childe in the ninth month, both bring forth a childe: yet there is great difference; the one is a strong childe, a gets the full growth; the other a weake childe, who hath not gotten the full growth. So the sinnes of the children of God get never the full growth; but the sinnes of the wicked get the full consent and growth.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The comfort that a Christian hath, who is stained with some great sinne.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He foyled Christian is he who hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len <note place="margin">Canon.</note> into some great sinne.</p>
               <p>The consolation to him is, that he <note place="margin">Comfort.</note> hath not fallen quite away. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> there was flesh and Spirit, even when he was given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Satan and excommunicate. <hi>Eutychis,</hi> when he fell <note place="margin">Acts 20. 10.</note> dead from an vpper loft, all who beheld him thought he was dead: <hi>Paul</hi> imbraces him in his armes, and sayes, <hi>He is not dead,</hi> his life is yet in him; the Saints of GOD will get great falls, and in the iudgement of men seeme to be dead; yet the Lord imbraces them in the armes of his mercy, and sayes, they are not dead, there is yet life in them.</p>
               <p>Some things are of the Spirit, but not with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; <note place="margin">Nota.</note> as the gifts of common illumination. Secondly, some with the Spirit, but not of the Spirit; as the sinnes of ignorance and infirmitie in the Saints. Thirdly, some both with the Spirit, and of the Spirit, as the saving gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Elect. Fourthly, some neither of the Spirit, nor with the Spirit; as the sins of malice, and reigning sinnes in the wicked. The foyled Christian comes never to this degree.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are miserable comforters to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <note place="margin">Canon.</note> sundry wayes.</p>
               <p>First they hold, that they haue the same power which <note place="margin">Illust. 1.</note> Christ hath to remit sinne; because they make the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ (as they speake in the Sacrament) we and they differ in this poynt.</p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:179309:172"/>
               <p>To conceiue this the better, we must consider, in the forgiuenesse of sinne, that there is a threefold power, the first is <hi>authoritatis,</hi> the second is <hi>potestatis,</hi> the third <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is <hi>ministerij. Authoritatis</hi> is that, which one hath prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally of himselfe, and not of another; so God onely pardons sinnes: the second, <hi>potestatis,</hi> or <hi>excellentiae,</hi> which one exercises, delegat from another, but by way of excellencie; and so Christ as Mediator, pardons sinne: thirdly, <hi>Ministerij,</hi> when onely by intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the name and authoritie of the soveraigne Lord he proclaimes it: and so Ministers pardon sinnes; God pardons <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Minister onely but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>There is <hi>totum potestativum,</hi> and <hi>totum contractum; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> totum potestativum,</hi> is the power which is in the King; <hi>totum contractum,</hi> is the power which is in an inferiour Magistrate: <hi>totum potestativum,</hi> is the power of seeing in the soule; <hi>totum contractum,</hi> is the power of seeing in the eye: Christ hath the whole power; but his Ministers haue it not as <hi>totum contractum,</hi> as inferiour Magistrates haue power; but onely as Heralds or Pursevants, who make intimation of the Magistrates decrees; but haue no power at all in their owne persons, but clothed with the authoritie of the Superiour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the manner of the confession, they are <note place="margin">II.</note> miserable comforters.</p>
               <p>Wee hold that confession is necessary: for, as vnder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Law, hee who held any vncleane thing in his hand, although he washed himselfe never so often, he was still vncleane; so he who repents of his sinnes, and keepes one still, is still vncleane.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee hold, that for greaer sinnes, greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> confession is requisite. <hi>Peter</hi> thrice denyed Christ, he got three admonitions by the Cocke: Christ as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him three times, <hi>Louest thou mee Peter? &amp;c.</hi> so <note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 7.</note>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:179309:172"/> he must confesse three times, because his sinne was so great.</p>
               <p>They hold, that in Confession there must be all these <note place="margin">Nauar. Instr. ad conf.</note> circumstances; who sinned, when he sinned, how he sinned, how often he sinned; and they will haue the whole sinne <hi>circumstantionatum,</hi> to be confessed: this Confession, (they say) it merits. This particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, (they say) it merits. This particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of all sinnes (for to make a pick-locke of it, and to learne out the secrets of the world) is iniurious to the estate of the Common-wealth: but to thinke to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by it, is iniurious to the merits of Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the sinne confessed, they are miserable <note place="margin">III.</note> Comforters, in which wee and they differ.</p>
               <p>They hold, that sinne is <hi>veniale ex causa, veniale ex forma,</hi> and <hi>veniale ex eventu;</hi> they set vp <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, they hold, that there is a sinne, <hi>veniale ex</hi>
                  <note place="margin">II.</note>
                  <hi>forma,</hi> which is so little in selfe, euen <hi>Peccadillo,</hi> so that it merits not death; when as the Apostle sayes, that <hi>The wages of sinne is death:</hi> but sinne hath both a <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> potentiall and an actuall guilt in the wicked; yet ehre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is possibilitie of pardon, if they had grace to seeke it; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but otherwise it is damnation in them. Secondly, sinne hath a potentiall guilt, but not an actuall guilt, as the sinnes of the godly: Here is <hi>reatus concapiscentiae, sed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>on personae: The guilt of last, but not of the person.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:179309:173"/>
               <p>Here is <hi>damnabilitas,</hi> but not <hi>damnatio.</hi> Thirdly, sinne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hath both the potentiall, and actuall guilt, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pardoned; as the sinne against the Holy Ghost. But we denie that there are sinnes so small, which haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> neither the potentiall nor the actuall guilt. The sinnes of the wicked, are like the Serpent, which hath power <note place="margin">Num. 21. 6.</note> to sting, and doth actually sting; but yet might be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The sinnes in the children of God that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, are like the Serpent that hath no power to sting, although it haue a sting in it selfe; as the Viper vpon <note place="margin">Acts 28. 5.</note>
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> hand. The sinnes of those, who commit the sinne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> against the Holy Ghost, are like the Serpent which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">Psal 58. 4.</note> not be charmed at all. But that there is a Serpent which hath no venome at all in it, or a sting to hurt, that wee denie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Veniale ex eventu,</hi> through the mercy of God, wee <note place="margin">III.</note> grant, that sinne is pardonable; but not through the smallnesse of the sinne it selfe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the medicine they are miserable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters: <note place="margin">IIII.</note>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. They propound onely the outside of Christs sufferings to sinners; as his whipping, scourging, and the paines of his bodie: but they never set before them, the inward part of his suffering, the torments which he suffered in his soule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they mixe the merites of the Saints, with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the merites of Christ for consolation; like the Iewes at the first, when they were to execute malefactors, they gaue them wine to comfort them, alledging that place of the <hi>Proverbs 3. 6. Giue wine to him who is of a sad heart:</hi> but afterward they found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this; to mingle Myrrhe, and to giue it them in their drinke, for to make their heath giddi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that they might feele no paine: but they were miserable comforters in this; and Christ refuses this kinde of drinke. So at the first, the Church of God, presented to the sad hearted, and miserable sinners, in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:179309:173"/> their death, onely the blood of Christ: but the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as miserable comforters, began to mixe sinne (like <hi>bitter Myrrhe)</hi> as mens merits, and the milke of <note place="margin">This is <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis,</hi> Psal. 60.</note> the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and such like trash, with the bodie of our Lord: but as the Lord refused that wine mixed with Myrrhe; so should all Christians in their death, refuse this mixed drinke, which will intoxicate their braines, and take them onely to the blood of Christ. The <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibion,</hi> playes now in the water, &amp; now vpon the land; but when shee is once wounded, then shee is glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre to the land. So Papists, although now they play like <hi>Amphibia,</hi> betwixt Christs merit, and mans merit; yet in their death they are glad onely to take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the merit of Christ. <hi>Bellarmine, Tutius est in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la morte Christi acquiescere: It is more sure to rest in the onely death of Christ.</hi>
